          Hey Girl !<br />
          You wanted to read the chapter right?<br />
          <span class="comments">// Here it is, did you think I would just send you a screen shot?</span><br />
          It was the day it all began,<br />
          <span class="comments">// Chapter 4 Unexpected encounters.</span><br /><br />

          It was just another ordinary day.<br />
          My friend and I were sitting at a small, dimly lit café — the kind where conversations linger and secrets feel safe.<br />
          “I’ve been talking to someone,” I said casually.<br />
          He raised an eyebrow.<br />
          I handed him my phone, her profile picture glowing on the screen.<br />
          “This is her,” I added, almost nervously.<br />
          He barely looked at the phone before his eyes shifted, and with the calmest nod, he said, “Turn around.”<br />
          I did. And there she was. Her.<br />
          Sitting right behind me. Laughing. Talking. Existing.<br />
          The universe didn’t just play a trick on me — it slammed me right in the chest with it.<br />
          I froze. Every cell in my body screamed to vanish on the spot.<br />
          I wasn’t dressed well — probably wearing a faded hoodie and worn-out jeans — not exactly how I imagined seeing her for the first time again.<br />
          But it didn’t matter.<br />
          Because there she was.<br />
          And I couldn’t take my eyes off her.<br />
          She didn’t notice me, thank God.<br />
          Maybe fate was being kind, or maybe it just wasn’t the time yet.<br />
          But in those few stolen moments, I got to see her — really see her.<br />
          The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she laughed,<br />
          the way her eyes lit up mid-sentence,<br />
          the effortless way she fit into the world around her while somehow standing out in every way.<br />
          And the smell… God, the smell.<br />
          She probably wasn’t even wearing perfume — maybe it was just her.<br />
          But it was the kind of scent you don’t forget.<br />
          Soft, clean, familiar in a way that made me ache.<br />
          Even now, I catch traces of it in random moments, and my heart forgets how to beat normally.<br />
          In that moment, I wasn’t just a boy showing his friend a girl he liked.<br />
          I was a boy who had just seen a sign.<br />
          Call it fate, coincidence, divine chaos — but it was something.<br />
          And I was absolutely, helplessly…Hooked.<br /><br />

          She left the café a few minutes later — her laugh still echoing faintly in my ears, her presence lingering in the space like perfume that never really fades.<br />
          I watched her walk away, and even though she hadn’t noticed me, I felt like I had just shared something with her.<br />
          Something silent. Something that only I knew.<br />
          I sat there in a daze, food untouched, my friend talking but his words just sounds in the background.<br />
          I wasn’t listening.<br />
          I was replaying it over and over — the way she looked up from her phone, the way her fingers rested on the cup, the curve of her smile when she spoke.<br />
          I felt something, definitely.<br />
          A tug in my chest.<br />
          That quiet ache of wanting, of curiosity, of maybe something more.<br />
          But it wasn’t enough — not yet — to take the leap.<br />
          I didn’t want to rush it, didn’t want to ruin it, whatever it was.<br />
          So I just sat there.<br />
          Still.<br />
          Awestruck.<br />
          And strangely content just having seen her again.<br />
          Like the universe had handed me a postcard from fate and whispered, “She’s still here.”<br />
          But I didn’t chase after her.<br />
          I couldn’t.<br />
          Not yet.<br /><br />

          That night, I couldn’t get her out of my head.<br />
          Every little detail from the café replayed itself on an endless loop — the way her hair fell to one side, the way she tilted her head when she spoke, even the way she held her cup like it was the most delicate thing in the world.<br />
          It was maddening.<br />
          I couldn’t focus on anything else.<br />
          I didn’t want to.<br />
          I knew it was ridiculous — we hadn’t even spoken that day, she hadn’t even seen me — but still, it felt like I had been struck by something I couldn’t explain.<br />
          Like just being in the same room had rearranged something inside me.<br />
          By the time the world outside had gone quiet and my room was only lit by the glow of my phone screen, I gave in.<br />
          I opened our chat on Facebook.<br />
          Typed.<br />
          Deleted.<br />
          Typed again.<br />
          Paused.<br />
          I wanted to tell her everything — that I saw her, that she looked beautiful, that I couldn’t stop thinking about her.<br />
          I wanted to ask her if she had smelled the moment too — if she had felt the air shift like I had.<br />
          But I didn’t.<br />
          Instead, I just sent something safe.<br />
          Casual.<br />
          Stupid, maybe.<br />
          “Hey, how was your day?”<br />
          I stared at the message for a while, hoping she’d read between the lines.<br />
          Hoping she’d feel the storm I was holding back, the chaos wrapped in those five words.<br />
          She replied a while later.<br />
          Nothing extraordinary.<br />
          Just a normal message.<br />
          Friendly.<br />
          Polite.<br />
          But it was enough to keep me awake that night.<br />
          Heart full.<br />
          Words buried.<br />
          Still afraid to say what I really wanted to.<br /><br />

          <span class="comments">// And there's more.</span><br />
          All I want to say is:<br />
          I will love you forever;<br /><br />
